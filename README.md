# vagrant-ansible
A Vagrant setup I made to learn Ansible.

Just clone the repo and run `vagrant up` to get some machines. This repo also has the playbook for working on those machines.

You'll have to edit the `servers` file to point to the machines you have set up. IP addresses are in the `Vagrantfile`.
